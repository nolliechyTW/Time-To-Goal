## 🛠️ Project Structure

As shown in the diagram below, the project consists of three main parts:

1. **DailyScrum**: Short-term to-dos that users can add to their lists (Green).
2. **Timer**: The focus timer associated with each to-do item, created each time a user starts working on a to-do item (Yellow).
3. **Task**: Long-term goals with accumulated time (Blue).

Detailed annotation of each class and their relationships can be found in the diagram.

## 📘 Story

TimeToGoal was created to address a gap in the market: the need for a time-management tool that alleviates stress rather than induces it. After testing over 20 task-management apps, we realized most of them focused on short-term achievements and made daily failures feel personal. They overwhelmed users with daunting task lists and fostered unrealistic expectations.

We envisioned TimeToGoal as a tool to encourage long-term dedication towards goals, making the process more manageable and less stressful, especially for those who struggle with ADHD. Our app shifts the focus from daily tasks to achieving long-term goals.

Embarking on this project without prior mobile app development experience, we challenged ourselves to learn Swift and Xcode from scratch in a single day. This rapid educational journey involved setting up our project on GitHub and mastering app design, including creating and linking Views and managing data flow seamlessly within the app.
