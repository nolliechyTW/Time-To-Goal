## 🛠️ Project Structure

The project consists of three main parts, each color-coded for clarity:

1. **DailyScrum**: Short-term to-dos that users can add to their lists (Green).
2. **Timer**: The focus timer associated with each to-do item, created each time a user starts working on a to-do item (Yellow).
3. **Task**: Long-term goals with accumulated time (Blue).

In the diagram below:
- **Deep colors** represent views, which are the user interface components.
- **Shallow colors** represent associated objects, which handle the data and logic.

Detailed annotations of each class and their relationships can be found in the diagram.

## 📘 Story

TimeToGoal was created to address a gap in the market: existing time-management tools often induce stress rather than alleviate it. Most focus on short-term achievements, which can overwhelm users. 

Our vision was to develop a tool that promotes long-term dedication towards goals, making the process more manageable and less stressful, especially for those who struggle with ADHD. TimeToGoal shifts the focus from daily tasks to achieving long-term goals.

We embarked on this project with no prior mobile app development experience, learning Swift and Xcode from scratch in a single day. Our development process was a rapid educational journey, involving everything from setting up our project on GitHub to mastering the nuances of app design, such as creating and linking Views and managing data flow seamlessly within the app.

We finally won the Best Beginner Prize @FemmeHack 2024. Cheer for the girls! 🎉
