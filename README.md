## Inspiration
Our journey with TimeToGoal began with a realization: the market is flooded with time-management tools, yet none seemed to fit our unique needs. As someone who has experimented with over 20 task-management apps, I found that most of them induce stress rather than alleviate it. They focus on short-term achievements, making daily failures feel personal, overwhelm users with daunting task lists, and foster unrealistic expectations of progress. This insight led us to envision TimeToGoalâ€”a tool designed not just for tracking time but for encouraging long-term dedication towards goals, making the process more manageable and less stressful, particularly for individuals like me who struggle with ADHD.

## What it Does
TimeToGoal stands out by shifting focus from daily tasks to achieving long-term goals. Unlike conventional apps that bombard you with daily or weekly tasks, TimeToGoal encourages users to set and pursue substantial goals, like mastering a skill with a 1000-hour investment. It features a customizable goal list and a timer tracker to record the time spent on activities, promoting gradual progress toward substantial achievements. The app caters to varied interests and allows for smaller, more approachable goal settings, exemplified by users' diverse goals ranging from becoming a LeetCode master to exploring new hobbies like dancing and climbing.

## How We Built It
Embarking on this project without prior mobile app development experience was a daring move. We took on the challenge of learning Swift and Xcode from scratch in a single day. Our development process was a rapid educational journey, involving everything from setting up our project on GitHub to mastering the nuances of app design, such as creating and linking Views and managing data flow seamlessly within the app.

## Challenges We Ran Into
The development path was fraught with challenges, particularly in data management across the app's various sections. Creating an intuitive and smooth user experience required overcoming significant obstacles, necessitating creative problem-solving and persistence.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Our greatest accomplishment is the creation of TimeToGoal. The app is a testament to our hard work, learning, and teamwork throughout the hackathon. It represents not just a functional tool but a step towards solving a common problem of low productivity by promoting long-term investment in personal goals.

## What We Learned
This project was a profound learning experience. It deepened our understanding of mobile app development's complexities and ignited a passion for innovation. We learned the value of perseverance, teamwork, and the creative resolution of challenges in the face of steep learning curves.

## What's Next for TimeToGoal
Our vision for TimeToGoal's future includes enhancing its functionalities and improving its UI design to prepare it for an official launch on the app store. We're committed to refining our solution, making it even more user-friendly and effective in helping users achieve their long-term goals.
